    print(f"{question}: {answer}")

print()
answer1 = input("Enter your choice (1-6): ")
print()

#### Question 1: Score the question

answer1 = int(answer1)    # Make sure the string entered by the user is changed to an integer
if answer1 == 5:
    print("Correct!")
    correct += 1    # Increment their score if they get the answer correct
else:
    print("Sorry champ...")

print("Question 2: Read this internet review and try to guess the Australian attraction... ")

print()
time.sleep(2)

print("Review #1... \n 'Damned waste of money from itâ€™s inception. Too far from the city proper and more often than not, the shows are elitist rubbish. Poor parking!'")

print()
answer1 = input("What attraction is this? ... ")
print()
if answer1.lower() == 'sydney opera house':
    print("Correct!")
    correct += 1    # Increment their score if they get the answer correct
